            or omissions. All materials, prices and service descriptions are
            subject to change without notice. Your use of this site is at your
            own risk, and SKYMAN GROUP INC shall not be liable for any direct,
            indirect, incidental or consequential damages arising from access
            to or use of the site.</p>
        <p>All information and materials on this website are provided
            "as is," without any express or implied warranties of any kind,
            including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness
            for a particular purpose or non‑infringement. Any opinions or
            materials posted are those of their respective authors; SKYMAN GROUP INC does not endorse any opinions expressed and assumes no responsibility
            for them.</p>
        <p>The terms governing the carriage of goods—including liability
            for loss, damage or delay—are set forth in federal law (the Carmack
            Amendment) and in separate written contracts between SKYMAN GROUP INC
            and the shipper. Federal law requires carriers to issue a bill of
            lading and makes them liable for the "actual loss or injury" to
            property; however, carriers and shippers may agree to limit
            liability by written or electronic declaration of the cargo's value.
            SKYMAN GROUP INC only assumes responsibility as defined by applicable
            laws and the contracts it enters, and such responsibility may be
            limited to agreed amounts. Nothing on this website modifies the
            terms of any bill of lading or transport contract.</p>
